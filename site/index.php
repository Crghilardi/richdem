<p>RichDEM is a collection of fast and optimal algorithms for analyzing watersheds.</p>

<p>Both the D8 and D-infinite methods are supported for all algorithms.</p>

<p>RichDEM can perform pit-filling, flat resolution and determine flow accumulation (aka contributing area and upslope area), flow directions, slope, and aspect profile. If you have a need which is not met by RichDEM, arrangements can be made to modify it to suit your needs.</p>

<p>RichDEM takes advantage of parallel processing techniques to harness the full power of the computers on which it is run.</p>

<p>RichDEM integrates with ArcGIS 10 for ease-of-use and better workflow.</p>

<p>RichDEM is still in development, but will be available by June.</p>

<p>Please contact Richard Barnes (<a href="mailto:rbarnes@umn.edu">rbarnes@umn.edu</a>) if you have any questions.</p>
